				<p>I've worn all kinds of different hats, but I'm really a teacher and designer at heart.</p>

				<p>I'm currently working as an Instructional Designer with the <span class="highlight-red">Distance Education department at MUN</span>. In this role, I get to train faculty on all of our online teaching tools, as well as develop learning materials. I regularly do one-on-one and group training sessions for faculty on campus and off. I know how to be clear, concise and get the message across. </p>

				<p>Before that, I filled several roles at <span class="highlight-red">Eastern Health</span>. I was part instructor, part data analyst, part documenter. During the H1N1 pandemic, I helped design and deliver essential information for front-line healthcare workers. It was pretty stressful, but pretty neat at the same time. </p>

				<p>Last, before that, I spent a few years as a <span class="highlight-red">classroom teacher</span>. I worked in junior high and high schools around town. That was pretty neat too.</p>

			<p>You guys are probably the coolest company in town. Talk of nerf guns and kegs on wheels on Friday evenings has made the rounds.</p>

			<p>More than that, it really looks like you're working on an important and meaningful problem, and having fun while you're doing it. I've heard through several friends that Verafin is an excellent place to work &mdash; not every company has employees saying that about them.</p>
